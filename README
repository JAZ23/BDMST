BDMST - Bounded Diameter Minimum Spanning Tree

We are working on an ant based algorithm to approximate solutions to
the BDMST problem. 

Authors: Christopher Jackson, Jason Jones


To Do:

-Format output so we can easily determine statistics using another script.
-Create script to gather statistics.
-Gather information from prior research regarding run times and best results to compare to our findings.
-Code optimization functions.
-Gather what diameter bounds we should be using.
